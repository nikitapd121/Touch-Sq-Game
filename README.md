# Touch_Sq_Game
A basic interactive website where multiple squares are displayed. When you touch or click any square, it changes to a different color and reveals a number.

As a beginner, I have recently started using GitHub and am still gaining familiarity with its features. I apologize for any inconvenience. You can find the code for the Touch DQ game in the Basic directory.
